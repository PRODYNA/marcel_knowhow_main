# General Purpose
The project's aim is to provide knowledge to a persona named Marcel. Marcel is new to the company
TODO Descripe the persona

TODO Describe the link persona to this project

# Scenario of the Project
TODO Describe the scenario

# View of Thougts and Reflections in the Project
## Business view
Fictional: A customer wants to provide an online quizz for theme of European history to attract users. If the customer gains more then 1'000'000 users he wants to monetize by offering a Pro subscriptions for other themes paying 5 Dollar/yearly subscription with the expectation of 1% conversion.
What will the production cost? What will be the yearly costs? What are typical questions besides costs?


## Project Organization and Management (10-15%)
How to manage and plan the project? What kind of approach will we use? Do we need trainings?


## Design and Conception (15-20%)
How to "catch" the user?
How do we create the User Experience?
How do we get feedback from the customer and the customer's users?
Where and how do we  document?
How can the product be found?
What kind of users do we have?
How can we design the product (especially the UI) to achieve which goals (e.g., a hip/conservative impression?)
How can we assess the quality?
How do we interact with development?


## Data View (10-20%)
What kind of data do we need?
Where do we get it from?
How can we move the source data into what we want?
What kind of (user) data/insights do we want?
Can we create or reuse data?
Where can AI help us?


## Software Engineering (30-40%)
What kind of technologies are used and what's the impact?
What kind of people do we have and the customer?
Do we need trainings or reviews?
Do we work cross-cutting/fullstack?
Which components do we want and what is the impact?
How can we develop independently from each other a big system?
What can we automize?
How can we ensure "code quality"?
Where can we use AI (for automization)?
Data safety and protection?


## DevOps (10-15%)
Where will it run (Cloud? Which cloud)?
How can we integrate the development with the shipping (CI/CD, GitOps)?
If we run in the cloud how can we check the costs?
Can wie optimize costs (FinOps)?
How can we monitor and log the system?


## Managed Services
What do we need to achieve the promised readiness?
Do we know the system?
Is montioring, logging, networking setup up?
Do we and the customer know the contacts?


# Limitations / TODOs

# Non-Techical Limitations
The artifacts of the following areas are not yet part of the project:
- No project planning related artifects
- No project management related artifects
- No design and conception related artifects

## Architectural and Technical Compromises
- No General Architecture documents.
- No unit, integration or end-to-end tests
- No 100% clean separation of concerns (e.g., this repo contains the AI generator script)
